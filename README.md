![foaaam norns main screen image, bubbles](/doc/foaaam_mainscreen.png)
a bubbly pitch-shifting delay/looper, with live performance and looper modes. inspired by the sequencing mode of the famous chase bliss thermae pedal. 

foaaam lets you define two pitch intervals and two step durations to creates a 3-step pitch sequence, created by changing the delay timing.
